## 🚀 Technical Architecture

### Tech Stack
```
Frontend:      Flutter 3.x + Dart
State:         Provider (MVVM pattern)
UI Framework:  Material Design 3
Local Storage: GetStorage
Payments:      Stripe (ready)
Routing:       Named routes + navigation stack
Responsive:    ScreenUtil for all screen sizes
```

### Project Structure (Clean Architecture)
```

├── config/              # Theme, constants, app configuration
├── models/              # Data models (Trip, User, Country)
├── providers/           # State management (Auth, Search, Trip)
├── services/            # Business logic (Storage, Mock API)
├── screens/             # UI screens organized by feature

│   └── search/         # Modular search components
└── main.dart          # App entry point with routing
```

### Architecture Decisions

**Why Provider + MVVM?**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Easy to test and maintain
- Minimal boilerplate
- Scales from MVP to production

**Why modular search widgets?**
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Reusable across app
- Easy to refactor
- Testable components

**Why GetStorage over SharedPreferences?**
- Faster, encrypted storage
- Better for complex data
- Future-proof for migration

## 🏆 Technical Highlights

### Problem: Managing Complex Search State
**Solution:** Provider pattern with clear separation—SearchProvider handles state, individual widgets handle UI. No prop drilling, easy to debug.

```dart
// Clean, testable state management
final searchProvider = Provider.of<SearchProvider>(context);
searchProvider.setLocation(city);
searchProvider.setDateRange(start, end);
```

### Problem: Reusing Components Across Screens
**Solution:** Extracted modular widgets into `lib/widgets/search/` directory. Each component is self-contained and reusable.

```dart
// Reusable, focused components
CitySearchField(controller, onSelected)
DatePickerField(startDate, endDate, onSelected)
GuestPickerField(adults, children, onChanged)
```

### Problem: Responsive Design Across Devices
**Solution:** ScreenUtil scales all dimensions, fonts, and spacing proportionally. Build once, works on phone/tablet.

```dart
width: 120.w,        // Scales to screen
fontSize: 16.sp,     // Responsive text
padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.w)  // Consistent spacing
```

### Problem: Recent Searches Not Syncing
**Solution:** GetStorage with try-catch error handling. Data persists across app restarts with graceful fallbacks.

```dart
// Robust, production-grade storage
StorageService.addRecentSearch(
  city: city,
  date: dateRange,
  categoryIndex: index,
);
```
